# I built the same tool twice with Claude Code. The second time was easier AND better.

*LinkedIn Post - November 30, 2025*

A few weeks ago, I tried building a Chrome extension to save my LinkedIn posts. You know the problem—you save something brilliant, then it vanishes into LinkedIn's unsearchable void.

My first attempt worked. Kind of. The data extraction was messy. Missing comments. Broken formatting. Half the posts came out garbled. I was proud I'd shipped something, but it wasn't a tool I'd actually use.

Last week, I rebuilt it. Same tool. Same Claude Code. Completely different outcome.

The difference? Plugins.

The first time, I was working with vanilla Claude Code. This time, I had a systematic debugging skill that traces problems backward to their root cause instead of randomly guessing. I had development workflows that think through architecture before writing code. Product sense baked into the process.

Three hours later: a fully functional Chrome extension. It captures posts exactly as I see them—author info, comments, engagement stats, everything. I can toggle whether to include comments on a per-post basis. Export to JSON. Generate AI embeddings for semantic search with Gemini, OpenAI, or Voyage AI.

The irony? The more sophisticated version was *easier* to build.

Not because there was less troubleshooting—there was plenty. But every problem had a systematic path to resolution. The debugging skill alone probably saved me hours of frustrated guessing.

Here's the thing about AI tools: the base model is just the starting point. The plugins, the workflows, the skills you layer on top—that's where the magic happens.

Next up: building a RAG database so I can actually query years of saved posts.

If you're using AI coding tools, don't stop at the defaults. The ecosystem around them is where things get interesting.
